# heat-distribution

This program will simulate and visualize the heat distribution
across a metal plate. The plate will have restricted cells
that are either the coldest or hottest points on the plate.
The unrestricted cells are free to change, by taking the average of
its surrounding cells. The simulation will continue until two
iterations have data within epsilon of each other.
